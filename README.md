### Persona

Version 0.0.1

#### Overview

Persona is a small single-page Rails app that renders my CV in a format that I find satisfyingly minimalistic, while
affording me complete control over the content and layout.

The intent is to generate a HTML CV that looks good in browser and prints to PDF in an acceptable manner.

Provided as is for amusement.
